        Experience in the game for around two years now, started in shadowland and still playing, mainly into pushing mythic plus keys. However i have dipped my toes in PvP peaking at 2050 rating in shadowland. I also just recently got in to raids this expansion, which i am really enjoying. Currently playing a dps for my mythic plus group, however i have healed and tanked for past seasons of mythic plus.
